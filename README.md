### 2. Renaming to MD5 Hash Name ‚úèÔ∏è

#### **Purpose:**
This script handles file renaming and cleanup for files downloaded from VirusShare and MalwareBazaar, ensuring they are correctly formatted for analysis.

**VirusShare files:** The script removes the `VirusShare_` prefix, leaving only the MD5 hash as the filename.\
**MalwareBazaar files:** The script renames executable `(.exe)` files to their MD5 hash and deletes all non-executable files.

#### **How to Use:**
1. Set the folder_path or destination_folder variable to the directory containing the downloaded malware samples.  
2. Run the script. It will:
    - Process VirusShare files by stripping the "VirusShare_" prefix.
    - Process MalwareBazaar files by renaming .exe files to their MD5 hash and deleting other file types.
3. After execution, only properly renamed MD5 hash files will remain in the folder.

#### Expected Output:
- For **VirusShare** files:
```
Renamed 'VirusShare_1234567890abcdef' to '1234567890abcdef'
File renaming completed.
```
- For **MalwareBazaar** files:
```
Renamed 'sample.exe' to 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e'
Deleted 'sample.dll'
```

### 3. Getting JSON report of each file using VirusTotal üìÑ

#### **Purpose:**  
This script automates the retrieval of **VirusTotal reports** for malware samples using their **MD5 hash filenames**. It distributes API requests between multiple API keys, saves the reports as JSON files, and manages **API rate limits** by handling quota exhaustion.

#### **How to Use:**  
1. **Set the `folder_path` variable** to the directory containing malware sample files.  
2. **Add VirusTotal API keys** to the `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEYS` list. The script will distribute requests between them.  
3. Run the script, and it will:  
   - Extract the **MD5 hash** from each file's name.  
   - Query **VirusTotal** for a report.  
   - Save the report as a **JSON file** in the specified folder.  
   - **Automatically handle API quota limits** by waiting until the quota resets.  
   - Keep track of processed hashes to avoid redundant requests.

#### **Expected Output:**

- When a report is successfully retrieved:
```
Saved JSON report for 1234567890abcdef
```
- If an API key‚Äôs quota is exhausted:
```
API quota for API key [key] is exhausted.
The quota will be restored in X minutes.
```
- If an error occurs:
```
Error occurred for [hash]: [status code] - [error message]
```
- When processing is complete:
```
All files have been processed.
```

### 4. Verify from reports and remove any non-executable file üîç‚úîÔ∏è

#### **Purpose:**  
This script ensures that files in the `onlyPrograms` directory are genuine Windows executables by cross-referencing their VirusTotal JSON reports. It removes both the JSON reports and corresponding files that are not identified as "Win32 EXE" files.

#### **How to Use:**  
1. **Set the `reports_folder` variable** to the path containing your VirusTotal JSON reports.
2. **Set the `main_folder` variable** to the path containing your main files (e.g., executables).
3. Run the script; it will:
   - Open each JSON report in the `reports_folder`.
   - Check if the `type_description` attribute is "Win32 EXE".
   - If not, delete both the JSON report and the corresponding file in the `main_folder`.
   - Provide output detailing which files are kept or deleted.

#### **Expected Output:**

- For a file identified as a Win32 EXE:
```
sample1.json is Win32 EXE. Keeping both JSON report and main file.
```
- For a file not identified as a Win32 EXE:
```
sample2.json is not Win32 EXE. Deleting JSON report and main file.

### 9. Main classifier program üóÇÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è

#### Purpose
This script classifies malware samples based on AVClass results. It processes JSON reports, extracts classification labels, and organizes the corresponding executable files into categorized folders. It first converts JSON reports into a **one-liner format** before running AVClass, as AVClass requires this format for proper processing.

#### How to Use
1. Ensure the following directories exist (If not, create them and provide the absolute path to the folders):
   - `new_malware` (Contains executable files)
   - `new_malware_json` (Contains JSON reports)
   - `categorizedMalware`
   - `nonClassMalwares`
   
2. Run the script; it will:
    - Convert JSON Reports: Each report is reformatted into a one-liner JSON.
    - Run AVClass: AVClass processes the formatted JSON and extracts malware classification labels.
    - Organize Executables:
        - If a class label is identified, the file moves to /categorizedMalware/<Class>/<Family>/.
        - If only a family label is found, it moves to /nonClassMalwares/<Family>/.
        - If no valid labels are found, the file remains unclassified (Very less posibility).
        - If AVClass does not provide any class name but only the family name then it goes to `nonClassMalwares`.

3. For Example: The files are named like `backdoor_adwind_2018_1.exe` , where `backdoor` is class name, `adwind` is family name, `2018` is its creation year and `1` is its sequence number. If an executable with same class and family appears again it would get a sequence number `2`

#### **Expected Output:**

- Malware executables are systematically categorized into labeled folders based on AVClass classification.
---
### 10. Delete orphaned JSON reports üìÑüóëÔ∏è

#### **Purpose:**  
This script removes **orphaned JSON reports** that no longer have corresponding executable files. It ensures that the `new_malware_json` folder only contains JSON reports for existing executables. This is usually used if the classification system had stopped mid process, due to which, executables have moved but the reports folder still contains the report.

#### **How to Use:**  
1. **Set the folder paths** in the script:  
   - `json_folder`: Path to the folder containing JSON reports.  
   - `executable_folder`: Path to the folder containing executable files.  

2. **Run the script**, and it will:  
   - Scan all JSON files in `new_malware_json`.  
   - Check if the corresponding executable exists in `new_malware`.  
   - **Delete** JSON files that don‚Äôt have matching executables.  
   - Print the names of the deleted files.  

#### **Expected Outcome:**  
- Only JSON files with valid executables remain.  
- Orphaned JSON files are removed.  
- The script prints messages for each deleted file:  
```
Deleted sample1.json 
Deleted sample2.json
```
- Once finished, it prints:  
```
Cleanup complete.
```

### 11. Final checks ‚úîÔ∏è

### **Purpose:**  
This script **corrects filenames** by adding the missing **class name** to executable files in categorized malware folders. It ensures all filenames follow a consistent format. 
- This step was added as upon scrutinizing the dataset some files were not named correctly. It would not be needed frequently. 

### **How to Use:**  
1. **Set the `folder_path` variable** to the categorized malware directory.  
2. Run the script, and it will:  
   - Scan all executable files in subfolders.  
   - Check if the filename **contains the class name**.  
   - If missing, **add the class name** from the parent folder.  
   - Ensure no duplicate filenames exist by appending a **version number** if needed.  
   - Rename the files accordingly.

### **How to Use:**  
1. **Set the `malware_folder` variable** to the directory containing categorized malware.  
2. Run the script, and it will:  
   - Scan all **class folders** (top-level categories).  
   - Identify **family folders** (subcategories within each class).  
   - Count the number of **executable (.exe) files** in each family.  
   - Store the data in **`malware_categories.csv`**, structured as:  

   | Class/Family | Family_1 | Family_2 | ... | Family_N |
   |-------------|----------|----------|-----|----------|
   | Class_1     | Count    | Count    | ... | Count    |
   | Class_2     | Count    | Count    | ... | Count    |
   | ...         | ...      | ...      | ... | ...      |
   | **Total**   | Sum      | Sum      | ... | Sum      |

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- A CSV file (`malware_categories.csv`) with a **detailed count of malware samples** categorized by **class and family**.  
- The **"Total" row** at the bottom will sum the number of files per family across all classes.
